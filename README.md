# ZotHacks 2020: Team 12 Project

This is the project repository for Team 12's ZotHack Project "Food Finder" where you can input various ingredients you want to use and health restrictions you want to heed. Then you can submit these and get the name of a dish we think you should make!

We built off of the ZotHack 2020 frontend workshop repository to build this, so you may see some familiar files and directories, but the pages that we render were all created separately (mostly searchPage, recipePage and their respective components).
